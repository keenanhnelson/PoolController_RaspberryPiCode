----------2/13/17----------
I have changed from programming in c to programming in c++. I currently have a working 
model. I need to commit using git. Then I will implement everything using classes.
----------2/9/17----------
I added a boundary feed back switch for the servo motor which prevents it from going 
too high and a place to reset. I have added modifications to pins at the bottom.
----------2/9/17----------
Need to figure out how to make a feed back switch for the servo motor. I may need to 
redesign my linear actuator button presser.
----------2/7/17----------
Fixed servo issue. Need to make sure to configure after disabling the servo.
Reset to origin function works now.
I need to add a structre for all the variables pertaining to a motor
Need to fix issue with linear actuator arm 
----------2/6/17----------
Servo not working at all
----------2/5/17----------
I am currently having issues with Servo moving before I tell it

Stepper right and left
	Turn on 	= GPIO 0
	Step Signal = GPIO 6
	Direction 	= GPIO 2

Stepper forward and backward
	Turn on 	= GPIO 3
	Step Signal = GPIO 4
	Direction 	= GPIO 5

Servo up and down
	PWM signal 	= GPIO 1
	Direction  	= Controlled by PWM signal

Origin Switches
	Right 		= GPIO 7
	Bottom		= GPIO 8
	Servo 		= GPIO 9
