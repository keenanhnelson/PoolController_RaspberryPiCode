----------12/2/18----------
-Got Rid of the use of CMake to build executable
-Separated all the classes into different files
----------2/4/18----------
-Changing the Servo class to ServoContinuous and adding ServoPosition to handle the 
	different servo configurations. I am not using a ServoPosition in my current 
	design
----------2/3/18----------
-This is a brand new version of the hardware.
-removed pActivate from deactivating stepper motor and added a function to deactivate
	the stepper motors.
-exposed delay between steps. Added StepDelay to initial variables. 
	StepDelay allows for different speed stepper motors

This code will now take a before image send that image to the smartphone then push the 
requested button next it will take an after image lastly it will send a confirmation 
message. All of the basic functions now work. I will need to add the ability to take 
images without pushing a button.
----------4/16/17----------
added .gitignore and removed unnecessary files that git was tracking.
----------3/26/17----------
Added OpenCV functionality. cmake is now used to create the Makefile. Webcam is used 
to take before and after images.
----------3/21/17----------
I have cleaned the code up a lot and made three different classes. One class for the 
stepper motors, another for the servo motor, and the last one controls all the other 
classes.
----------2/29/17----------
Now works to press buttons relative to each other. But the code has a lot of repeats.
----------2/16/17----------
I need to figure out how to set Left or Right as the positive direction. I also need 
to fix my relative movement.
----------2/13/17----------
I have changed from programming in c to programming in c++. I currently have a working 
model. I need to commit using git. Then I will implement everything using classes.
----------2/9/17----------
I added a boundary feed back switch for the servo motor which prevents it from going 
too high and a place to reset. I have added modifications to pins at the bottom.
----------2/9/17----------
Need to figure out how to make a feed back switch for the servo motor. I may need to 
redesign my linear actuator button presser.
----------2/7/17----------
Fixed servo issue. Need to make sure to configure after disabling the servo.
Reset to origin function works now.
I need to add a structre for all the variables pertaining to a motor
Need to fix issue with linear actuator arm 
----------2/6/17----------
Servo not working at all
----------2/5/17----------
I am currently having issues with Servo moving before I tell it

Stepper right and left
	Turn on 	= GPIO 0
	Step Signal = GPIO 6
	Direction 	= GPIO 2

Stepper forward and backward
	Turn on 	= GPIO 3
	Step Signal = GPIO 4
	Direction 	= GPIO 5

Servo up and down
	PWM signal 	= GPIO 1
	Direction  	= Controlled by PWM signal

Origin Switches
	Right 		= GPIO 7
	Bottom		= GPIO 8
	Servo 		= GPIO 9
